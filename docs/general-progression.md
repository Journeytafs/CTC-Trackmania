Front Page Descriptions
These sections retain their conversational tone for in-game use, with minimal adjustments for clarity.

Double Description (In-Game Club):
"Everything is designed, as much as possible, with incremental difficulty.
Basic road tricks, tech, nascar, all surfaces, substyles, and niche styles—even tricks like Galaxy Drift and Gorilla Grip—will have specific maps.
The "intended" way is to start with basic concepts like elevations and steering, progress through surface mastery, and eventually explore mixed styles, Speedfun, LOL, RPG, and niche milestones like Deep Dip.
Players are free to explore any map but, for beginners, this serves as a small manual."

News Page (In-Game):
"Due to limited time, the initial goal was to make all maps myself. However, I’ve shifted focus to include maps from talented creators, filling gaps while celebrating community contributions.
This approach creates a living tutorial while showcasing the incredible creativity of the Trackmania community.
We aim to provide links to communities like FullSpeed Family and Ice Communities to make this a practice hub.
Have fun, and feel free to share ideas or suggestions for improvement!

Surface-specific challenges, like Dirt FullSpeed or Grass Tech, are sorted by surface for now until a better system is discovered."
