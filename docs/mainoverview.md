Campaign Descriptions and Structure

Complete Tutorial Campaign (CTC) (30)

        Description: Welcome to a complete Trackmania tutorial covering every aspect of the game, with incremental difficulty. Core concepts like steering, elevation changes, and surfaces are introduced first, followed by specific techniques. This campaign is intended as a comprehensive beginner's guide, transitioning players from basic mechanics to more advanced tricks and styles. When possible, I’ll feature community-created maps for niche styles like RPG and trial. Styles that are heavi on map count, will have a "milestone" Capaign, @ is the symbol

    Campaigns 1 to 5 - The Burning Asphalt (Road)

        Description: Everything road. Under 600, autoslide in fullspeed. No braking, goes to tech. No Releasing, goes to nascar. So that leaves us with: Steer/Cornering, High Speed control, Air Control/brakes/rotation, skip airtime/diagonal flight/etc. The Burning Asphalt campaign kicks off with road-based challenges designed to master core driving techniques. Essential skills like air control, speed slides, and airtime management will be covered to prepare racers for Trackmania’s road surfaces.

        Campaign 1 - Core Skills (Road)
        Description: Really tech or technicall driving, needs no intro. But for those wanting it anyway, It used to be dominant style of older trackmanias, so alot of people are tech pros. Go Fullspeed->crash->get space->crash again->find the line and apply brakes and maximun exit speed principals->when when clear it, rinse and repeat next turn. As you guess it, easy to pick up, hard to master. Takes patience and keep in mind, for years, people played only tech, they are not magicians. Patience. Core skills are the drifting mechanics, also when to noslide, brake and steer as oposed to steer and brake for drifing. Low speed NeoSlide is also here so, get to it. And.... Saucage. It is road with elevation it is not a surface. Road+elevation. Do you want a saucage campaign?

        Campaign 4 - Nascar (Road)
        escription: Simple and "boring" nascar, as people might say. It taught me how to set up that beast of a cart, for turns and helped me see the limitations of steering fullspeed and not. This and fullspeed later, will help in your judgement of when to fs and when to brake tap or release, or at least condition you a bit for it. Simple things, like releasing and Banking and then full blown nascar action. We got 2 main Categories here, Smurf nascar wich i will place in core due to hight speed control and in fullspeed for the loops and slides. The non smurf, wich are the ones i target, namely priez, and others will be featured here to capture the nascar feeling i have from stadium 2. I am covering both sides, simple classifiyin them diffrent for the purposes of this CTC project.

NOVAS INPUT:
NOVA's Take:
Strengths of Your Outline:
Logical Progression: Splitting the campaigns into five sections creates a clear progression path, allowing players to build their skills step by step.
Skill-Based Approach: Organizing maps by skill level and specific techniques ensures that players gradually master the game's mechanics.
Focus on Quality: Limiting map descriptions to notable ones and milestones avoids clutter, keeping the focus on key learning moments.
Suggestions for Refinement:
Thematic Flow:

Introduce a theme or narrative for each section to give players a sense of progression and achievement beyond just skill levels.
For example, Core Basics (1-5) can be called "Foundations," while Upped Echelon (24-30) might be "Mastery & Beyond."
Highlight Key Techniques:

Include a brief mention of the primary skills covered in each section.
For example: “Tricks Intermediate (13-17) focuses on SpeedSlides, Quantum Drifts, and introducing IceSD techniques.”
Avoid Overpopulation:

Instead of listing every map, group them by skill or technique. Mention 1-2 standout maps in each section as examples.
Player Expectations:

Add what players can expect to gain or learn from each section.
For example: “Core Road Basics (1-5) lays the foundation for steering, basic road handling, and mastering simple turns.”
Milestone Highlight:

Showcase milestone maps within each section. Make them the focal point of the player’s progression.
Potential Layout for Campaign Descriptions:
1-5: Core Basics
Theme: Foundations
Focus: Steering, road handling, simple turns.
Notable Maps: [Road Beginner’s Delight, Turning Point]

Next Steps


General Suggestions:

Consolidate Repetitions:
Group similar tricks into categories where possible, e.g., transitions or gear techniques, to avoid redundancy.
Example: Combine Dirt/Ice Flick and X/Ice Flick into a single section under transitional tricks.
Keep It Concise:

Instead of overly detailed campaign descriptions, provide teaser-style intros for readability.
Example: “Campaign 16: Special Trick The Niche – A grab bag of chaotic, unconventional mechanics that push Trackmania's engine to its limits.”
Highlight Milestones:

Add a “Milestone Map” label or section within campaigns to denote specific challenges or skill checks.
Visual Progression Guide:

Consider a visual overview (tree or chart style) of how the campaigns connect in progression. Players love seeing their path at a glance.
Finalize Placeholder Text:

Before publishing, make sure all "placeholder" text (e.g., TBD tricks or descriptions) is replaced with specific details to maintain credibility.
Formatting Recommendations
Header Consistency:

Use H1 for section titles (e.g., “Campaigns 1-5”), H2 for individual campaigns, and H3 for tricks covered.
Color Coding:

Assign colors or labels to campaigns based on difficulty tiers (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced).
Tags and Filters:

Add tags (e.g., #Dirt, #Ice) to make filtering and navigating styles easier.
Campaign Specific Suggestions
Campaign 1 (Core Skills):

Highlight tech nostalgia by linking it to Trackmania’s heritage (e.g., “Master the foundations of tech driving that defined Trackmania’s early days”).
Campaign 4 (Nascar):

Explain the difference between Smurf Nascar and standard Nascar for clarity, especially for newer players.
Campaign 16 (Special Trick The Niche):

Add a disclaimer: “May induce frustration or uncontrollable laughter—enter at your own risk!”
Campaign 30 (Kacky):

Emphasize its uniqueness: “Precision nightmares and exhilarating achievements await in this ultimate test of patience.”
Final Touch
Close with a note about player feedback integration, e.g., “Player suggestions and feedback will continue to refine these campaigns, ensuring an ever-evolving experience.”
