# Tricks & Techniques

Trackmania Mastery
Each campaign focuses on specific techniques to help players refine their skills in a structured progression. This section serves as a reference for players, offering detailed explanations of core tricks and advanced methods.

## Core Techniques

### SpeedSlide
Mastering high-speed maneuvers on full-speed maps:
- S4D (430-600 Speeds): Achieved with brake-tapping and full steering control.
- Forced SpeedSlides: Initiate slides directly after landing from elevations for smooth transitions.

### Quantum Drift
Perfecting drift control on unconventional surfaces (dirt, grass, plastic):
- Setup: Align skid marks with full steering input.
- Execution: Combine full-steer with SpeedSlide for optimal drift.
- Tip: Practice advanced racing lines for effective setups.

### Diagonal Flight
A signature A01 technique for optimized landings:

- Control: Maintain diagonal trajectory mid-air.
- Precision: Requires practice to outperform straight jumps on select tracks.

### Inside Line with airtime Beats Airtime reduction line
Advanced air control technique for tight lines:

- Objective: Reduce airtime while maintaining the shortest path.
- Moves: Use left-right rotation and brake tapping mid-air to refine jump angles.

## Specialized Techniques

### Braking & Release Timing Before Jumps
Essential for controlling airtime

- Pre-Jump Brakes: Tap brakes before jumps to manage airtime effectively.
- Controlled Release: Ease off speed before airtime-heavy sections for smoother landings.

### Additional Air Control
Finely tune your mid-air adjustments

- Rotation: Control left-right spin for precise landings.
- Mid-Air Brakes: Apply light braking to refine angles or prevent overshooting.

### Style-Specific Techniques

#### Ice Techniques
- Gorilla Grip: Maximize traction.
- IceSD: Master speed slides on ice.
- 90 Degree Shield: Nail sharp turns with precision.

#### Nascar Techniques
- Releasing and Banking: Handle high-speed banking effectively.
- High-Speed Control: Refine balance and momentum on long straights.

#### Galaxy Drift
An advanced full-speed drift:
- Momentum Control: Harness curved trajectories.
- Rarity: A niche skill for standout tracks.

#### BugSlide
A tricky but rewarding technique:
- Entry Angle: Requires sharp, deliberate positioning.
- Execution: Maintain stability during high-speed slides.
